                    <h1>EXPRESS FROM THE HEART</h1>
                    <p>Seva means selfless service; one of the key components and aspects of bhakti is serving God with<br /> love along with serving His children and creation. With this principle of seva, we transcend <br />differences based on culture, colour, religion, gender, age and even species, and live together in love<br /> and harmony.</p>
                    <p>In India, and around the globe, there are numerous ways for you to offer an expression of your heart <br />and to utilise your skills in the service of others within the various projects initiated by H.H.<br /> Radhanath Swami. Whether it be as a doctor at one of the yearly health camps, an ashram resident <br />learning and serving at the Bhakti Center in New York, a Bhakti Recovery Group leader for those<br /> healing from addiction, or a volunteer serving meals to those in need. There are many ways to get<br /> involved.</p>
                    <p>If you are inspired to serve and wish to find out ways how,<br />
