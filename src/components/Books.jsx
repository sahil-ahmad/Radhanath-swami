            <p>Whenever I look back to that day, I am reminded how<br/> prayers may be answered in ways we never expect. To<br/> grow may require that we be shaken right to our core.<br/> While kneeling on that roadside in Herat, something<br/> died within me, giving birth to a realization necessary<br/> for me to move forward in my path. With each step, a<br/> camel lifts its hoof from a stable place on earth in order<br/> to move forward. And to reach the sea, each ripple of <br/>the river must let go of its present state to surrender to <br/>the current.</p>

                <h3>THE JOURNEY HOME</h3>
                <p>Within this extraordinary memoir, Radhanath Swami weaves a colorful tapestry of<br/> adventure, mysticism, and love. Readers follow Richard Slavin from the suburbs of <br/>Chicago to the caves of the Himalayas as he transforms from young seeker to<br/> renowned spiritual guide.</p>
                <p>The Journey Home is an intimate account of the steps to self awareness and a<br/> penetrating glimpse into the heart of mystic traditions and the challenges that all<br/> souls must face on the road to inner harmony and a union with the Divine.</p>
                <p>Through near-death encounters, apprenticeships with advanced yogis, and years of<br/> travel along the pilgrim’s path, Radhanath Swami eventually reaches the inner<br/> sanctum of India’s mystic culture and finds the love he has been seeking. It is a tale<br/> told with rare candor, immersing the reader in a journey that is at once engaging,<br/> humorous, and heartwarming.</p>
